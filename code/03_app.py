# Urban Happiness Index Dashboard
# This Streamlit app visualizes urban happiness data, allowing users to explore various business questions
# and their corresponding plots. Users can select different plot types and business questions to analyze urban factors affecting happiness.

# Run this app using the command in the terminal:
# streamlit run C:/Users/julia/OneDrive/Desktop/Projects/Project-City-Happiness-Index/code/03_app.py



# Import necessary libraries
